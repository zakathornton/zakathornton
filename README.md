## Hi, I'm Zak ðŸ‘‹
<p>I'm a postdoctoral research statistician and epidemiologist based at Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine (LICAMM) at the University of Leeds, UK <br>
The focus of my research is using epidemiological methods to investigate novel drug targets for the treatment of rheumatological and vascular diseases, primarly giant cell arteritis (GCA).

<p>My academic interests:<br>
<ul>
<li>Genetic epidemiology</li>
<li>Mendelian randomisation</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
<li>Evidence synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>Education:
<ul>
<li>2020-2024 - PhD Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol</li>
<li>2018-2019 - MSc Genomic Medicine, University of Sheffield</li>
<li>2014-2017 - BSc Biomedical Science (Hons), University of Sheffield</li>
</ul>
