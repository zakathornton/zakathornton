## Hi, I'm Zak ðŸ‘‹
<p>I'm a ICEP Genetic Epidemiology PhD Student at the University of Bristol, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ <br>
The focus of my research is using epidemiological methods to investigate novel drug targets for the treatment of glioma ðŸ§ <br>

I mainly use R, Command line and Python.<br>
<p>My academic interests:<br>
<ul>
<li>Mendelian Randomisation</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
<li>Evidence Synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>Education:
<ul>
<li>2020-Present - PhD Genetic Epidemiology, University of Bristol</li>
<li>2018-2019 - MSc Genomic Medicine, University of Sheffield</li>
<li>2014-2017 - BSc Biomedical Science (Hons), University of Sheffield</li>
